      <h3>Carseek Secure Servers</h3>
      <p>
        At Carseek we want to assure our visitors that the information you
        provide us is used only to fulfill your request for price quotes on
        vehicles you have chosen. Our secure servers use the most up-to-date
        software to maintain your privacy.
      </p>
      <h3>How We Use Your Information</h3>
      <p>
        We will never forward your information to a dealer who, in our
        experience does not afford our visitors the same security measures we
        enforce. We will forward your contact information to the dealer who can
        provide a price quote on your chosen vehicle, and who makes the same
        privacy promise as Carseek. The dealers in your chosen zip code who
        satisfy the above rules will be allowed to contact you with new car
        prices and other info.
      </p>
      <h3>Contact Us</h3>
      <p>
        We hope this privacy policy settles any uncertainty you may have had
        about Internet security at Carseek. We take security on the web
        seriously and appreciate your trust. Contact us if you have any
        questions or concerns about security at Carseek.com
